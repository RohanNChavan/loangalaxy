      <h2 class="section-title">Types of Loans We Help With</h2>
      <p class="section-sub">
        Your requirement is unique. Below are common loan purposes where customers apply through NextGen Finance.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Personal Loan</h3>
          <p>
            A flexible loan used for emergency expenses, travel, wedding, home renovation, or other personal needs.
            Personal loans are usually unsecured and depend on eligibility and repayment capacity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Medical Emergency Loan</h3>
          <p>
            In urgent medical situations, quick access to funds can help. Customers often apply for short-to-medium term loans
            to cover hospitalization, surgery, or recovery costs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Education / Skill Loan</h3>
          <p>
            Education-related expenses like courses, certifications, or coaching can be supported through structured loan options.
            Suitable for working professionals and students (as per eligibility).
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="cards" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Debt Consolidation</h3>
          <p>
            Many borrowers choose to consolidate multiple EMIs into one easier payment.
            This can simplify finances and improve monthly cash flow.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Home Renovation</h3>
          <p>
            Renovations can be expensive. A loan for repairs or upgrades can help you plan better without draining savings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Wedding / Family Expenses</h3>
          <p>
            Weddings often include major expenses like venue, travel, gold, and arrangements.
            A planned personal loan can help manage big costs smoothly.

  <!-- Eligibility -->
  <section class="section alt" id="eligibility">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Eligibility & Important Factors</h2>
      <p class="section-sub">
        Eligibility is based on multiple factors. Understanding them helps improve approval chances and reduce delays.
      </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>1) Employment status</h2>
        <p>
          Employment type directly affects loan eligibility. Salaried applicants typically have stable monthly income and predictable
          cash flow, which can help in faster evaluation. Self-employed borrowers may be assessed on business stability, income history,
          and consistency of earnings. Students and unemployed individuals may require additional checks or co-applicant support
          depending on the loan provider.
        </p>

        <h2>2) Monthly income</h2>
        <p>
          Income is a key indicator for repayment capacity. Lenders usually check if your existing obligations (like EMIs, rent, credit card payments)
          still leave room for another EMI. A higher income can improve eligibility and can also impact available loan amount.
        </p>

        <h2>3) PAN details</h2>
        <p>
          PAN is required for identity and credit assessment. It allows verification and helps evaluate the credit behavior (like timely repayments).
          Always enter your PAN carefully in the correct format. Even a small mistake can cause application errors.
        </p>

        <h2>4) PIN code and location</h2>
        <p>
          Some loan providers may serve selected geographies. PIN code helps identify your serviceable area and ensures faster processing.
          A correct address PIN code reduces back-and-forth and delays.
        </p>

        <h2>5) Requested loan amount</h2>
        <p>
          Loan eligibility depends on the amount requested. If a customer requests a higher loan amount than their eligible limit,
          approvals can get delayed. We recommend applying with a realistic range based on monthly income.
        </p>

        <h3>Common reasons for delay or rejection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Incorrect PAN format or mismatch</li>
          <li>Invalid phone number / unreachable applicant</li>
          <li>High existing EMI burden vs income</li>
          <li>Incorrect pincode / non-serviceable location</li>
          <li>Multiple recent applications across platforms</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Documents Typically Required</h2>
      <p class="section-sub">
        Exact requirements vary based on profile and lender. These are the most commonly requested documents.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Identity Proof</h3>
          <p>PAN card is required. Some providers also request Aadhaar for verification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Income Proof</h3>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Simple tip to avoid errors</h2>
        <p>
          Keep documents ready and ensure details match — especially name spelling, PAN, and registered mobile number.
